# Fraud_Analytics
#### Descriptive and  Predictive Analytics  for a Synthetic dataset on Financial crimes. 

Jupyter Notebook with EDA and Predictive ML for financial crimes predictions.  The dataset https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1/download is a synthetic one  i.e. simulated using PaySim  based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The dataset is scaled down 1/4 of the original dataset.

The dataset can be downloaded from here https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1/download to tghe root folder of  this Jupyter Notebook for replication of the experiments. I did not  upload it for space limitations.

Enjoy!
